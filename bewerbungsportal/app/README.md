# NodeJS App

## Start developing
Before starting the development server one has to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). After installation open the `app` directory in your terminal and install all dependencies with `npm install`

Afterwards start the development server with `npm run dev` which will start a Nodemon who will restart when files in the directory are changed.
